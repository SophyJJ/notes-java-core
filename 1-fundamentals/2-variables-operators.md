# Variables, Math Operators

  - Strongly Typed = variables are declared with a data type and can only be assigned those values


## Primitive Data Types

  - built into the language
  - foundation of all types
  - 4 categories of primitive types:
    - Integer
      - byte - 8 bits (literal 0)
      - short - 16 bits (literal 0)
      - int - 32 bits (literal 0)
      - long - 64 bits (literal 0L)
    - Floating
      - float - 32 bits (literal 0.0f)
      - double - 64 bits (literal 0.0 or 0.0d)
    - Character: Stores single unicode char ('U' or '\u00DA')
      - char
    - Boolean: true or false
      - boolean
  - They are "stored by-value". Each variable has its own copy of data.

## Math Operators
  - 5 basic: +, -, *, /, %
  - prefix/ postfix: ++, --
  - Compound Assignment Operators: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
  - Precedent: prefix > /, * > +, - > postfix

## Conversions
  - Implicit:
    - widening conversions are automatic (from small to bigger types)
    - operations with mixed integer sizes will automaticaly convert all to largest type in equation
    - Operations with mixed floating sizes will automatically convert floats to double
    - Operations with integer and floating will convert integers to largest floating in equation
  - Explicit:
    - You can do narrowing or widening conversions
    - Just be careful with values not fitting on smaller types
