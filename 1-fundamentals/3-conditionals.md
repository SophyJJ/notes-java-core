# Conditionals

- Logical operators -> & | ^ !
  - They test both sides of the operator always
- Conditional logical operators -> && ||
  - Only execute the right side of the operator if needed

# Arrays

```java
// declare only
float[] theVals = new Float[3];

// you can initialize in the declaration too
float[] theVals = { 10.0f, 20.0f, 15.0f };

// loop over all elements
for(float var : theVals) {
   system.out.println(var);
}
```

# Switch

- Only chars are integers can be used for testing
