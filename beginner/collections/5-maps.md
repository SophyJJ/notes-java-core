## Maps

- Don't use the Dictionary class
- Only use the Map class
- YOu could use an ArrayList instead of a map, but performance would decrease by a lot
- Maps are very fast
- put will add or update value
- `Map` doesn't implement the `Collections` interface
- You can use views for Maps. `KeySet()`, `values()`, `entrySet()`. You can even modify the Map by removing elements from the views, but you cannot add elements to the Map
