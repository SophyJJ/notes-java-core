# Introduction

## What's problem with Arrays?
- not friendly to println
- arrays don't resize. Can't add new items. You need to write your own helper.
- very low level. You need to write lots of helpers
- can't specify constraints on elements, like duplicates, etc

## Java Collections Framework

- Java collections framework comes with the JDK. They implement data structures
- data structures are diverse. some provide ordering, uniqueness, pairs, etc
- they are complex. No need to rewrite your own.
