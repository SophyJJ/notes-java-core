# Reflection

- aka runtime examination + execution
- you can write code what will interact with classes that don't exist yet
- you can inspect classes to know their members, implemented interfaces, etc
- you can access members of that class and call methods
- all classes have a single `Class class` instance that you can access to interact with any class
- slower than traditional code, so use only when needed
- it's better to use a combination of reflection and traditional code
